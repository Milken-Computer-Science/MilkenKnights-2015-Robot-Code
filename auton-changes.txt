original code worked twice in a row

instead of just moving backwards, we button 9 for 1 second then move backwards
-tote stack barely hit edge of field, and we didn’t have time to move backwards

changed final pivot from 50->55
flaps now open before we start driving straight, instead of afterwards
-totes hit the knocked over second bin when being shot out (anamoly)

changed final pivot from 55->65
-it worked

alternate qualification mode: final pivot goes to 110 instead of 65
-12 volt battery: autonomous ended right before we button 9’d
-after fresh battery: totes got pushed, but the top tote slipped off because it wasn’t seated on the second tote. it wasn’t seated on the second tote because while pivoting and moving the elevator down at the end, it hit the edge of the last bin and got dislodged

realignment distance after pushing bin from 35->36
-had enough time to spit

we now start moving backwards at the same time as the spit happens
-worked

realignment distance changed from 36->38
while we pivot back to 0, we move the elevator to height 17
-worked

@ventura
straight p from 0.015 to 0.022
pivot p from 0.034 to 0.046
tote grab distance changed from 36 to 31
changed backup distance from 38 to 40
straight p from 0.022 to 0.0237
pivot p from 0.046 to 0.0495
-had problems

straight p from 0.0237 to 0.025
pivot p from 0.0495 to 0.05
backup distance from 40 to 42
-backup distance paused before moving forward

changed backup distance thres from 1.3 to 2.5
-ACTUAL PRACTICE MATCH: still had pauses

changed backup distrance thres from 2.5 to 4.5
-ACTUAL PRACTICE MATCH: pausing problems

changed final travel distance from 82 to 70
-practice match: overshot when grabbing second tote

changed tote backgruond distance from 71 to 67.5
changed tote wait distance from 68 to 64.5
-qual match: second bin moved forward too much when it was knocked over and it hit and misaligned the third tote

changed bin grab distance from 31 to 27.5
-qual match: we moved too fast at the end

speed limit at the end is 0.6
-qual match: didn't enclose enough of first bin

changed bin grab distance from 27.5 to 29
changed bin grab thresh from 1.3 to 2
